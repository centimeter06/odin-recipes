# odin-recipes
This is the first project I'll be doing in the foundations course of The Odin Project. In this project, I will be demonstrating the cumulation of all the efforts I've made these past few weeks in learning the basics of coding/programming by creating a website using HTML and GitHub. 

Said website will be focusing on recipes which will be provided to me through the website. I'm hoping to create a neat, organized code structure and I'm also hoping to be doing all the coding by myself, independent of any materials that may be available to me online (unless the usage is necessary).
