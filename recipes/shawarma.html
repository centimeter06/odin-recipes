        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Shawarma is one of the Middle East's most famous street foods. Originating from the 
            Ottoman Empire, it consists of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, <br> 
            and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or spit. It was traditionally made with lamb
            or mutton, but variations have included the use of chicken, turkey, beef, or veal. 
        </p>
        <p>Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates and are put into either
            a pita bread, lavash, or plated with a rice dish. To this day, it still stands as my <br>
            most favorite food from the Middle East, and my most favorite in general.

            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mix all the ingredients together in a non-reactive bowl and set aside to marinate for anywhere from 1 hour to overnight. Drain and discard any excess marinade.

                    <li>
                        To Broil: Heat an oven broiler to high. Spread the meat evenly in a single layer on an ovenproof pan. Set 4 to 6 inches under the broiler flame and broil until cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir halfway through to cook evenly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To Grill: Heat coals or set gas to high heat. Spread the meat in a grill basket and grill until cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
