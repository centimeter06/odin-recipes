        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Shawarma is one of the Middle East's most famous street foods. Originating from the 
            Ottoman Empire, it consists of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, <br> 
            and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or spit. It was traditionally made with lamb
            or mutton, but variations have included the use of chicken, turkey, beef, or veal. 
        </p>
        <p>Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates and are put into either
            a pita bread, lavash, or plated with a rice dish. To this day, it still stands as my <br>
            most favorite food from the Middle East, and my most favorite in general.
